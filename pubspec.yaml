# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts: # 配置字体，可配置多个，支持ttf和otf,ttc等字体资源
    - family: IndieFlower #字体名
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/IndieFlower-Regular.ttf
    - family: BalooBhai2 #字体名
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BalooBhai2-Regular.ttf
    - family: Inconsolata #字体名
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-Regular.ttf
    - family: Neucha #字体名
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Neucha-Regular.ttf
    - family: ComicNeue #字体名
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ComicNeue-Regular.ttf
    - family: TolyIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/iconfont/iconfont.ttf
